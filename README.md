# EG1310_ESD
Repository for EG1310: Modules that we need to program

## Sensors
1. HIH-4030 - Humidity sensor
2. LCD03-I2C - LCD 
3. TMP102 - Temperature sensor
4. BMP085 - Barometric pressure sensor module
5. HMC5883L - Triple axis magnetometer module
6. Xbee wireless comms module
7. SR403P - Servo motor assembly
8. 12-button keypad
9. Logic level converter board 
10. 5V Power supply module
11. 3.3V Power supply module

# May add the following systems
1. RGB Bright led for night signalling + debugging: feedback lights to observe status of the satellite
2. Wind sensor: https://moderndevice.com/product/wind-sensor/
  -   To measure wind speeds: not too sure about the power consumption
3. Ambient light sensor: used to activate the LED. So that we can conserve power
4. Might use the Arduino zero
5. Use a raspberry pi base station with ros webbridge to display graphical data
6. Use a PCB for components: more reliable and durable
7. Gyro-stabilized camera gimble with arduino mega


# Tentative Schedule
recess week:
decide all the components*	chassis planning will be done
- email profs about the parts if not we will be able to get the parts on time.

Week 7:
Assume that the confirmation is done; Buy and test all components;

Week 8:
Assemble and test

Week 9:
Integration + ruggedize

Week 10:
DEBUGGING

Week 11:
Send to the sky

Week 12:
